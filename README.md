# WorkflowGraph

**WorkflowGraph** is a lightweight, self-contained TypeScript library for building and executing directed graph workflows. It's an alternative to **LangGraph** for those seeking independence from LangChain and the flexibility to implement agent workflows, while still enabling real-time streaming of results.

The Python-version is available at [https://github.com/dextersjab/workflow-graph]().

## Features

- **Graph-based workflows**: Build flexible, directed workflows where nodes are customizable tasks.
- **Synchronous & asynchronous support**: Define both sync and async nodes without any external dependencies.
- **Real-time streaming**: Built-in support for callbacks in each node, allowing real-time token streaming (e.g., for WebSockets).
- **LangGraph alternative**: Unlike LangGraph, WorkflowGraph provides a simpler, fully self-contained solution without needing LangChain for streaming.
- **Modular architecture**: Organized into separate modules for better maintainability and extensibility.
- **TypeScript & JavaScript support**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions, but can be used in pure JavaScript projects.

## Installation

To install **WorkflowGraph** in your project, run:

```shell
npm install workflow-graph
```

## Using with JavaScript or TypeScript

This library is written in TypeScript for type safety but compiles to JavaScript for distribution.

### JavaScript Usage

```js
import { WorkflowGraph } from 'workflow-graph';

// Create the workflow
const graph = new WorkflowGraph();

// Add a simple node
graph.addNode('add', x => x + 1);
graph.setEntryPoint('add');
```

### TypeScript Usage

```ts
import { WorkflowGraph } from 'workflow-graph';

// With TypeScript, you can add type parameters to nodes
graph.addNode<number, number>('add', (x: number): number => x + 1);

// Execute with type safety
const result = await graph.executeAsync<number, number>(5);
```

## Basic Usage

### Implementing a Workflow

Here's how to create a simple workflow with conditional branching in **TypeScript**:

```ts
import { WorkflowGraph } from 'workflow-graph';

// Define task functions
function add(data: number, callback?: (msg: string) => void): number {
  const result = data + 1;
  if (callback) {
    callback(`Added 1: ${data} -> ${result}`);
  }
  return result;
}

function isEven(data: number): boolean {
  return data % 2 === 0;
}

function handleEven(data: number): string {
  return `Even: ${data}`;
}

function handleOdd(data: number): string {
  return `Odd: ${data}`;
}

// Create and configure the workflow graph
const graph = new WorkflowGraph();

// Add nodes
graph.addNode('add_one', add);
graph.addNode('is_even_check', isEven);
graph.addNode('even_handler', handleEven);
graph.addNode('odd_handler', handleOdd);

// Define starting point
graph.setEntryPoint('add_one');

// Define flow between nodes
graph.addEdge('add_one', 'is_even_check');

// Add conditional branching based on is_even_check result
graph.addConditionalEdges(
  'is_even_check',
  isEven,  // path function
  { true: 'even_handler', false: 'odd_handler' }
);

// Set endpoints
graph.setFinishPoint('even_handler');
graph.setFinishPoint('odd_handler');
```

This example creates a workflow that:
1. Takes a number as input
2. Adds 1 to it
3. Checks if the result is even
4. Branches to different handlers based on the result

The corresponding **Mermaid** diagram would look like:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "add_one" as add_one
    state "is_even_check" as is_even_check
    state "even_handler" as even_handler
    state "odd_handler" as odd_handler
    [*] --> add_one
    add_one --> is_even_check
    is_even_check --> even_handler: True
    is_even_check --> odd_handler: False
    even_handler --> [*]
    odd_handler --> [*]
```

### Error Handling and Retries

WorkflowGraph supports built-in error handling and retry capabilities:

```ts
graph.addNode('api_call', makeApiRequest, {
  retryCount: 3,                 // Retry up to 3 times on failure
  retryDelay: 0.5,               // Wait 0.5s Ã— attempt before retrying
  errorHandler: handleApiError   // Function called if all retries fail
});
```

## Execution Methods

Once your workflow is defined, there are two ways to execute it:

### Direct Execution (Simple)

For one-time executions, use the direct execution approach:

```ts
// Execute synchronously (internally uses async under the hood)
const result = graph.execute(inputData);

// Or execute asynchronously with a callback
const asyncResult = await graph.executeAsync(inputData, (partialMsg) => {
  console.log('Progress:', partialMsg);
});
```

### Compile-then-Execute (More Efficient for Multiple Executions)

For workflows that will be executed multiple times, compile once and reuse:

```ts
// Compile the graph
const compiledGraph = graph.compile();

async function runWorkflow(inputData: number) {
  // Execute with the compiled graph
  const result = await compiledGraph.executeAsync(inputData, (msg) => {
    console.log(`Progress update: ${msg}`);
  });
  console.log(`Final Result: ${result}`);
}

// Run the workflow with different inputs
await runWorkflow(5);
await runWorkflow(10);
```

## Generating Mermaid Diagrams

WorkflowGraph includes built-in support for generating [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams to visualize your workflow:

```ts
// Generate Mermaid diagram code
const mermaidCode = graph.toMermaid();
console.log(mermaidCode);
```

The generated diagram uses the stateDiagram-v2 format with the [*] notation for start and end states. Conditional branches are represented with labeled transitions. This provides a clean and intuitive representation of how the workflow behaves.

## Package Structure

The library is organized into the following modules:

- **workflow_graph**: Main package
- **constants.ts**: Defines constants like START and END
- **models.ts**: Defines data structures like `NodeSpec` and `Branch`
- **builder.ts**: Contains the `WorkflowGraph` class for building graphs
- **executor.ts**: Contains the `CompiledGraph` class for executing workflows
- **exceptions.ts**: Contains custom exceptions for better error handling
- **README.md**: Contains detailed documentation about the package internals

For convenience, a top-level `index.ts` file is also provided that re-exports all the public API.
